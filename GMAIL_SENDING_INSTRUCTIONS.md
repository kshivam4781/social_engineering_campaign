# How to Send HTML Email from Gmail

## The Problem
Gmail doesn't support CSS Grid, so the multi-column layout won't work when copy-pasting HTML directly.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Gmail's HTML Compose (Best for Gmail)
1. Open Gmail and click "Compose"
2. In the compose window, look for three dots (⋮) or "More options"
3. If you see "Insert HTML" or "HTML mode", click it
4. Paste your HTML code there
5. Note: This feature may not be available in all Gmail accounts

### Option 2: Use Email Service (Recommended)
Use professional email services that support HTML:
- **Mailchimp** (free for up to 500 contacts)
- **SendGrid** (free tier available)
- **Outlook** (better HTML support)
- **Constant Contact**

Steps:
1. Sign up for the service
2. Create a new email campaign
3. Use "Import HTML" or "Code Editor" option
4. Paste your HTML
5. Send to your recipients

### Option 3: Use Browser Extension
Install a browser extension like:
- **HTML Email Editor for Gmail** (Chrome extension)
- Allows you to paste HTML directly

### Option 4: Use Outlook or Thunderbird
1. Open Outlook or Thunderbird
2. Create a new email
3. Look for "Insert" → "HTML" or "Source" view
4. Paste your HTML code
5. Send the email

## Quick Fix: Convert to Single Column
If you need to send immediately from Gmail, I can convert the email to a single-column layout that will work in Gmail. Let me know if you'd like me to do that!
